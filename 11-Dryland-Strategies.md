* Introduction
    * Arrid = evaporation exceeds rainfall
    * rainfall < 80cm per year
    * can look like low crowned forest with shrub under-story
        * Has a [cryptogamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_soil_crust) fungal crust to prevent erosion  
    * Termites aerate the soil instead of worms and ants
    * Chapter focuses on areas with 40 - 100 cm rainfall
        * Note: Austin has around 86cm annually
    * You can plant trees to increase humidity via transpiration
* Precipitation
    * Some deserts have no precipitation
        * Plants here rely on dew
        * Moroccan foresters are (in the 70's) toying with the idea of installing large metal dew traps to water shrubs, which once established would sequester more dew
    * The Australian aboriginal term "walk about" was actually a tradition of the aborigines following the rainfall and harvesting the resources that grow with the rains, which allows them to preserve the local dry areas for future use  
* Temperature
    * The low temperature is usually 8°C - 30°C
    * Air temperature rises 10° - 25° by 12-3PM
    * Soil temperature peaks about an hour earlier
        * **Coolest at around 5 - 6 PM** - Verify, this looks wrong
    * Soil can hold more heat than air
        * 60° - 70°C at 5cm depth can be reached at peak
* Soils
    * expect alkaline soils, surface salts, and carbonates
    * PH 8.5 - 9.0 to even 10 - 11 can be expected
    * Draining sands can be irrigated with salt water at up to 1500 PPM concentration
        * This is higher concentration than can be used for foliage irrigation
    * Desert systems are extremely fragile, you need to assess often
        * You also need to do small tests before doing large projects, to make sure it is going to work
    * Plants that may benefit from soil amendments:
        * Acacias
        * Eucalyptus
        * Legumes
        * Pines
        * Casuarina
        * Even Garden Crops
    * Test your soil to know whats there and if you need to amend it.
    * Mineral solubility changes with PH
        * Plants may have a deficiency if the PH is wonky
        * Therefore changing the solubility can change the available minerals
    * Some notes:
        * burying plastic bags with pin holes and fertilizer under trees can keep them fertilized for their entire life
        * continuous pit mulching with jar's or such is an option?
        * Avoid all biocides, they rely on aquatic life that is missing to break them down

* Landscape Features
    * The designer needs to take in to consideration local wind, water, and infiltration
    * Rock and soil type, these will produce characteristics in local landforms
    * aspect - a tiny bit of shade can change the local ecosystem immensely
    * fire frequency
    * date of last rain greater than 12mm
    * Scarps and Wadi's (Cliffs and usually dry riverbeds)
        * Similar to humid area land features but usually more angular and less rounded
            * Less water to erode them?
        * Scarps often have caves or notches in them of varying sizes
        * You can find scour holes, eroded holes in the top of the scarp
            * You can turn these in to cisterns or if they are filled with sand, line the rim with rocks and plant trees
            * Important sites for birds and wildlife since they are just big pits that hold water after rains
