* Introduction
    * Arrid = evaporation exceeds rainfall
    * rainfall < 80cm per year
    * can look like low crowned forest with shrub under-story
        * Has a [cryptogamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_soil_crust) fungal crust to prevent erosion  
    * Termites aerate the soil instead of worms and ants
    * Chapter focuses on areas with 40 - 100 cm rainfall
        * Note: Austin has around 86cm annually
    * You can plant trees to increase humidity via transpiration
* Precipitation
    * Some deserts have no precipitation
        * Plants here rely on dew
        * Moroccan foresters are (in the 70's) toying with the idea of installing large metal dew traps to water shrubs, which once established would sequester more dew
    * The Australian aboriginal term "walk about" was actually a tradition of the aborigines following the rainfall and harvesting the resources that grow with the rains, which allows them to preserve the local dry areas for future use  
* Temperature
    * The low temperature is usually 8°C - 30°C
    * Air temperature rises 10° - 25° by 12-3PM
    * Soil temperature peaks about an hour earlier
        * **Coolest at around 5 - 6 PM** - Verify, this looks wrong
    * Soil can hold more heat than air
        * 60° - 70°C at 5cm depth can be reached at peak
* Soils
    * expect alkaline soils, surface salts, and carbonates
    * PH 8.5 - 9.0 to even 10 - 11 can be expected
    * Draining sands can be irrigated with salt water at up to 1500 PPM concentration
        * This is higher concentration than can be used for foliage irrigation
    * Desert systems are extremely fragile, you need to assess often
        * You also need to do small tests before doing large projects, to make sure it is going to work
    * Plants that may benefit from soil amendments:
        * Acacias
        * Eucalyptus
        * Legumes
        * Pines
        * Casuarina
        * Even Garden Crops
    * Test your soil to know whats there and if you need to amend it.
    * Mineral solubility changes with PH
        * Plants may have a deficiency if the PH is wonky
        * Therefore changing the solubility can change the available minerals
    * Some notes:
        * burying plastic bags with pin holes and fertilizer under trees can keep them fertilized for their entire life
        * continuous pit mulching with jar's or such is an option?
        * Avoid all biocides, they rely on aquatic life that is missing to break them down

* Landscape Features
    * The designer needs to take in to consideration local wind, water, and infiltration
    * Rock and soil type, these will produce characteristics in local landforms
    * aspect - a tiny bit of shade can change the local ecosystem immensely
    * fire frequency
    * date of last rain greater than 12mm
    * Scarps and Wadi's (Cliffs and usually dry riverbeds)
        * Similar to humid area land features but usually more angular and less rounded
            * Less water to erode them?
        * Scarps often have caves or notches in them of varying sizes
        * You can find scour holes, eroded holes in the top of the scarp
            * You can turn these in to cisterns or if they are filled with sand, line the rim with rocks and plant trees
            * Important sites for birds and wildlife since they are just big pits that hold water after rains
        * Water Storage
            * Start at top erosion surface
            * dam across valleys in upper plateau and let flood water seep through more slowly
            * cut gutters across top of scarp above useful caves
                * prevent too much water splashing over our cave-house sites
            * clear, deepen and seal the scour holes in the upper surface
                * Some of these can lie inside dam walls as deep spots
            * cut gutters away from main valley head and a larger proportion of the water to the side valleys
            * spill dams to excavated pools in cliff base
                * will gather silt and need to be cleaned eventually
            * You can grow VERY hardy trees in the upper surface if they are rock walled
                * To protect from flood waters?
                * To shade?
            * Erect strong walls on wadi floor to collect silt
                * For minor wadi's the entire thing can be walled
                * For larger ones, leave a large channel in it and build fields to the side
            * build earth and stone walls across lower plain to soak in the water
                * Top with unpalatable shrubs
            * The [Nabataeans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabataeans) have some of the most extensively researched wadi systems
            * For every 1 Ha of irrigated orchard, 20Ha of catchment is reserved
            * Minimum water left to run-off and rest left to soak in to desired area
            * Aim to absorb .5 to 1m of water for each field
            * requires active management in the storm, open upper resevoirs once rains cease to further absorb in to fields rather than lose to evaporation (guessing here)
            * Put windmill on top of well or bore on top of scarp to pump water and let it gravity feed to house below
            * Overgrazing is the biggest issue in arid lands
    * Residuals, Domes and Inselbergs
        * Example creating gutters on large stone domes to sunken/walled fields
        * 20 - 1 ratio of used land to caught water
    * Fold Mountains
        * Made up of Synclines and Anticlines
        * Daming rivers can create large lakes
            * 20-30:1 ratio of catchment to useable water
        * Slowing down violent rivers and diverting parts to silt traps, reed beds, and dams is a good strategy
    * Dune country
        * Occur as pavements or dune seas
        * Dunes on pavement can be planted after rains
            * fast growing grain or oat with acacia seedlings
            * Mixed with fertilizer
            * Grains grow fast and straw stays for a couple years
            * Acaias grow and effect permanent stabilisation
                * Acacia Victoriae
                    * Copious leaf mulch
            * tamarisk (large tree) may succeed if deeply set in dune base
            * Pelleted seed broadcast from air can work
                * mix seed, mud, fertilizer, insect repellant (copper sulphat with lime, neem powder, magnesite)
                * pass through bladless minser
                * vibrating tray with a slight slope
                * dry them
                * pellets won't get eaten by birds or insects
            * pitting is a good choice
                * disks with a quarter cut out on an axle dragged over ground
                * Seed pellets sown soon after
            * Dune blowouts on coasts need hand planting of quickset grasses
                * Ammophila spp.
                * mothbean seed
                * brushes in 7m squares
            * Dunes and dune fields can be thought of as large water tanks
            * Top 6m can only be 4% moisture, damp below, at 40m it is saturated
            * Dunes are the best place to establish permanent plantings, but we need to stabilize the dune
            * Dune Stabilisation
                * Salt surfaces, lichens, bacteria, fungi and algal mats form naturally and prevent erosiion, these prevent dunes from forming
                * These crusts break apart with hooves and agriculture and recreational vehicles
                * urgent stabilization can be done with tar oils, pebble beds, or brush fences
                * Fences
                    * .9 - 1m high
                    * Parallel rows 7m apart across the main wind direction
                    * wind gaps less than 50% to drop sand out
                    * posts every 3-4m 
                    * 12°C temperature reduction in the shade of these fences has been measured
                    * Moisture loss up to 3% less than open areas
                    * key to starting hardy perennials adapted to dunes
                * lethal soil temperatures rarely greater than 15cm depth
                * trees placed in holes this deep or deeper can survive until they are big enough to shade themselves
                    * Hole stabilized by woven basket or cardboard collar
                    * LOTS of fertilizer a waste since rapid infiltration will bring it below the roots
                        * wait until root web established to fertilize a lot
               * Pioneer plants must be able to survive stem burial until area is stablised
    * Depressions and Basins
